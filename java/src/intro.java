//java
//java is case sensitive language.you have to code carefully.
//byte code means programname.class.after execution the code .it creates programname.class  
//normal languages// sourcecode=>complier=>(source convert into 1010 by complier)(when i run,objectfile works)object file(1010=>processor.
//java languages//sourcecode=>complier=>byte code(1010)(when i run,jvm works) =>jvm or interpreter=>processor
//object file in c if i develop in windows.i need windows complier
//object file in c if i develop in macos.i need macos complier
//byte code in java if i develop in windows,macos or any thing.i need only jvm
// jvm we can say interpreter.
//complier completed read the code.which reads the object file
//interpreter line by line read the code.which reads the byte code.
//java virtual machine.
//jit =just in time complier.which utilizes if i coded function call or any code repeatly like thousand times,it would speed for which jit complier is inside jvm.
//java libaries and files is inside java virtual machine 
//java runtime environment is created as a bundle.bundle means jvm and java libaries and files//we can run the java
//jdk ->jre and javac,java tools is inside java developement kit.
//SE-standard edition 
//ide=integration developement integration. eg:netbeans ,eclipse,intellij IDEA
//ide is with complier and text editor which so fruitful for developer.
//if i have jdk ,i can use notepad
//if i have jre,i need ide.

//we can't run single code without class.
//methods in java
/*
 main()
 {
    loginuser();//methods
    getdetails();
    checkavailability();
    processpayment();
confirmbooking(); 
}

//classes in java
class user{
attributes are variable name.
string usernae;//variable name.
regis()
{}
}

//packages
//proper orgnaized classes in java.
//java.lang=>primitive,java.util=>date and time,java.io=>input and output class already defined here,java.lang.math=>these are mathematic function.//these are packages.
