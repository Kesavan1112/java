for example:
1.step 1:javac filename.java//if it compile sucessfully,it create class file like this=>filename.class
filename.class=>important three advantage
1.code secure(no one hack)
2.platform independent(we can use linx,windows,macos)
3.it does separate into two .one is output,another one is source code.
2.step 2:java filename or java filename.java//which indicates the run and which runs the class file that's means  filename.class 

basic things of java
1.javac filename.java =>dot which means extension(filename).
2.Object is superclass of all java class.


instance variable in java:
1.instance variable which means when we create variable without static keyword that's instance variable.
