1.what is streams in java?
stream is sequence of data.
they are two type of stream 
1.byte stream eg:if you stores image ,it uses byte stream.
2.character stream(unicode)


*java performs input and output through these stream.basically java provides abstraction .abstraction which means hide complexity.
*stream links on physical device for example keyboard.
*java implements these stream within class hierachy in java.io package


System.in =>in is reference variable of InputStream .n Java, a reference variable is a variable that points to an object's memory location, and an object is a reference variable

bytestream=>it uses image,pdf,audio etc.
bytestream are two classes that's 1.inputstream which refers byte value2.outputstream.
inputstream and outputstream are abstract classes.

if you read byte data ,that's inputstream
if you write byte data ,that's outputstream

whether anything ending with stream,they are called  bytestream


two paramount method:
1.read=>inputstream
2.write=>outputstream

characterstream=>it uses character.
it is two classes in characterstream 1.Reader 2.Writer.
Reader and Writer are abstract classes.


what is predefined stream?

1.System.in=>inputstream
2.System.out=>ouputstream
3.System.err=>errorstream

printstream:
*inputstream and outputstrem are printstream.
