/*In Java, the **`protected`** access modifier is one of the four main access levels (the others being `public`, `private`, and package-private/default). Understanding how to use `protected` effectively is important for controlling access to class members. Here’s a detailed overview of its usage:

### Key Features of `protected`

1. **Visibility**:
   - Members (variables and methods) declared as `protected` are accessible:
     - Within the same package (package-private).
     - In subclasses (derived classes), even if those subclasses are in different packages.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - `protected` members are inherited by subclasses. This allows subclasses to use and override these members.

3. **Not Accessible**:
   - `protected` members are **not accessible** from non-subclass instances in different packages.

### When to Use `protected`

- **Encapsulation with Flexibility**: Use `protected` when you want to allow controlled access to a class member for subclasses while still hiding it from other classes.
  
- **Framework Design**: When designing APIs or frameworks, `protected` allows derived classes to access base class methods and fields while keeping them hidden from the public API.

### Example of `protected` Usage

Here’s an example that demonstrates the use of `protected` in Java:

```java
// Base class
class Animal {
    // Protected variable
    protected String name;

    // Protected method
    protected void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " makes a sound");
    }

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Constructor
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Call the parent constructor
    }

    // Method that overrides the protected method from Animal
    @Override
    protected void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks");
    }

    // Public method to invoke the protected method
    public void bark() {
        makeSound(); // Accessing the protected method
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.bark(); // Calling the public method, which in turn calls the protected method

        // Directly accessing the protected variable from a subclass
        System.out.println(dog.name); // Accessible because Dog is a subclass of Animal
    }
}
```

### Expected Output:

```
Buddy barks
Buddy
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **`Animal` Class**:
   - The `Animal` class has a `protected` variable `name` and a `protected` method `makeSound()`.
   - The constructor initializes the `name` variable.

2. **`Dog` Class**:
   - The `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class.
   - It overrides the `makeSound()` method, allowing for polymorphism.
   - The `bark()` method in `Dog` calls the `makeSound()` method, which demonstrates access to the `protected` method.

3. **Main Method**:
   - An instance of `Dog` is created, and the `bark()` method is called, which in turn calls the `makeSound()` method defined in `Dog`.
   - The `name` variable is directly accessed because `dog` is an instance of a subclass of `Animal`.

### Access from Non-Subclass Classes

Here’s an example that shows access restrictions of `protected`:

```java
// Another class in a different package
package anotherpackage;

import mypackage.Animal; // Assuming Animal is in mypackage

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void meow() {
        // This will work because Cat is a subclass of Animal
        makeSound(); // Accessing protected method
        System.out.println(name); // Accessing protected variable
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat cat = new Cat("Whiskers");
        cat.meow(); // This works
    }
}
```

### What Will Not Work

If you attempt to access `protected` members from a non-subclass in a different package, it will result in a compilation error. For example:

```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
        // animal.name; // This line will cause a compile-time error
        // animal.makeSound(); // This line will also cause a compile-time error
    }
}
```

### Summary of `protected` Usage in Java

- **Controlled Access**: Use `protected` for members that should be accessible in subclasses but not from unrelated classes.
- **Inheritance**: `protected` members are inherited by subclasses, allowing them to access and override these members.
- **Package-private Access**: In addition to being accessible in subclasses, `protected` members are also accessible within the same package.
- **Encapsulation**: Helps maintain encapsulation while allowing necessary access for subclasses.

By understanding and using the `protected` access modifier, you can design your classes in a way that allows for flexibility and security in your Java applications. */
